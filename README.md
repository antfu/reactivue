## Usage

> It's currently expiremental and might have some breaking changes in the future. No production yet but feel free to try it out.

### Component Factory

```tsx
import React from 'React'
import { defineComponent, ref, computed, onUnmounted } from 'reactivue'

interface Props {
  value: number
}

const MyCounter = defineComponent(
  // setup function in Vue
  (props: Props) => {
    const counter = ref(props.value)
    const doubled = computed(() => counter.value * 2)
    const inc = () => counter.value += 1

    onUnmounted(() => console.log('Goodbye World'))

    return { counter, doubled, inc }
  },
  // functional component in React
  ({ counter, doubled, inc }) => {
    // you can still use other React hooks
    return (
      <div>
        <div>{counter} x 2 = {doubled}</div>
        <button onClick={inc}>Increase</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
)

// use it as you normally would
render(<MyCounter value={10}>, el)
```

### Hooks

You can use it as a hook as well.

> The `defineComponent` factory is actually a sugar to and equivalent to the following code.


```tsx
import React from 'React'
import { useSetup, ref, computed, onUnmounted } from 'reactivue'

interface Props {
  value: number
}

function MyCounter(Props: Props) {
  const state = useSetup(
    (props: Props) => { // props is a reactive object in Vue
      const counter = ref(props.value)
      const doubled = computed(() => counter.value * 2)
      const inc = () => counter.value += 1

      onUnmounted(() => console.log('Goodbye World'))

      return { counter, doubled, inc }
    },
    Props // pass React props to it
  )

  // state is a plain object just like React state
  const { counter, doubled, inc } = state

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter} x 2 = {doubled}</div>
      <button onClick={inc}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Hook Factory

To reuse the composition logics, `createSetup` is provided as a factory to create your own hooks.

you can create useMySetup in a store file, and use in other components

```ts
// ./store/useMySetup.ts
import React from 'react'
import { createSetup, ref, computed, onUnmounted } from 'reactivue'

interface Props {
  value: number
}

// 'useMySetup' can use any functional components and create multiple times
export const useMySetup = createSetup(
  (props: Props) => {
    const counter = ref(props.value)
    const doubled = computed(() => counter.value * 2)
    const inc = () => counter.value += 1

    onUnmounted(() => console.log('Goodbye World'))

    return { counter, doubled, inc }
  },
)
```

```tsx
// ./component/MyCounter.tsx
import { useMySetup } from '../store/useMySetup'

export const MyCounter = (props: Props) => {
  const { counter, doubled, inc } = useMySetup(props)
  const { counter: counter2, doubled: doubled2, inc: inc2 } = useMySetup(props)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>{counter} x 2 = {doubled}</div>
      <button onClick={inc}>Increase</button>
      <br/>

      <div>{counter2} x 2 = {doubled2}</div>
      <button onClick={inc2}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```tsx

## Using Vue's Libraries

Before you start, you need set alias in your build tool in order to redirect some apis from `vue` to `reactivue`.

#### Aliasing

<details>
<summary>Vite</summary><br>

Add following code to `vite.config.js` 

```js
{
  /* ... */
  alias: {
    'vue': 'reactivue',
    '@vue/runtime-dom': 'reactivue',
  }
}
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Webpack</summary><br>

Add following code to your webpack config

```js
const config = { 
  /* ... */
  resolve: { 
    alias: { 
      'vue': 'reactivue',
      '@vue/runtime-dom': 'reactivue',
    },
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Parcel</summary><br>

Parcel uses the standard `package.json` file to read configuration options under an `alias` key.

```js
{
  "alias": {
    "vue": "reactivue",
    "@vue/runtime-dom": "reactivue",
  },
}
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>Rollup</summary><br>

To alias within Rollup, you'll need to install [@rollup/plugin-alias](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/alias). The plugin will need to be placed before your `@rollup/plugin-node-resolve`.

```js
import alias from '@rollup/plugin-alias';

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    alias({
      entries: [
        { find: 'vue', replacement: 'reactivue' },
        { find: '@vue/runtime-dom', replacement: 'reactivue' }
      ]
    })
  ]
};
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>Jest</summary><br>

Jest allows the rewriting of module paths similar to bundlers. These rewrites are configured using regular expressions in your Jest configuration:

```js
{
  "moduleNameMapper": {
    "^vue$": "reactivue",
    "^@vue/runtime-dom$": "reactivue",
  }
}
```

</details>

#### Compatible Libraries

> A list of libaries that have been tested to work with `reactivue`. Feel free to make PRs adding more.

- [pinia](https://github.com/posva/pinia) - üçç Automatically Typed, Modular and lightweight Store for Vue
- [VueUse](https://github.com/antfu/vueuse) - üß∞ Collection of Composition API utils for Vue 2 and 3

## APIs

Some tips and cavert compare to Vue's Composition API.

#### Reactivity

The reactivity system APIs are direct re-exported from `@vue/reactivity`, they should work the same as in Vue.

````ts
// the following two line are equivalent.
import { ref, reactive, computed } from 'reactivue'
import { ref, reactive, computed } from '@vue/reactivity'
````

#### Lifecycles

This library implemented the basic lifecycles to bound with React's lifecycles. For some lifecycles that don't have the React equivalent, they will be called somewhere near when they should be called (for example `onMounted` will be call right after `onCreated`).

For most of the time, you can use them like you would in Vue.

#### Extra APIs

- `defineComponent()` - not the one you expected to see in Vue. Instead, it accepts a setup function and a render function that will return a React Functional Component.
- `useSetup()` - the hook for resolve Composition API's setup, refer to the section above.
- `createSetup()` - a factory to wrapper your logics into reusable custom hooks. 


#### Limitations

- No `getCurrentInstance()` - since we don't actually have a Vue instance here
- `emit()` is not available
